Sometimes we can have huge bursts of motivation towards our goals. This motivation can propel us 
towards completing say, 100 pages of a book, or 50 commits on a new project.

A lot of the time, we only get halfway through the goal. We become increasingly bored with each 
subsequent page, commit, feature, or step towards our overarching goal.

When we get halfway there, and our initial burst of motivation is gone (for example a few weeks 
after new years day), we can often be upset about this.

What I would say is we need to humanise our perspective of ourselves, and understand that this type 
of behaviour is completely normal and nothing to be ashamed of, and also beneficial to us.

During these periods of motivation, we make a lot of progress towards a goal, and gain greater 
understanding of what we actually want going forward. Our progress towards this goal shapes our 
perspective and shapes the way we see our lives going forward. In other words, the work we've 
put in has changed our own world by giving us an understanding of the world and ourselves through 
the lens of the work we've done.

For example, the process of reading a book, not only changes how I see the world, but it changes 
my own vocabulary, and therefore how well I can describe the world. It changes my knowledge of 
my own ability to read, and also at the same time increases my ability to read.

Going forward, after doing that reading, the difficulty I will have of reading will both be lessened, and 
more expected (therefore my ability to set my reading goal will increase).

Anyway, not quite sure why I wrote this post. Here's to completing my goal of 100 blogs in 2025!
