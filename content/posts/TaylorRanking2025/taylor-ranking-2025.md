~~So you're telling me I'm gonna have to relisten to a lot of music, including all of tortured poets department, 
midnights, folklore, evermore, and all of her previous work *again*. This will take a while.~~

Above is what I was originally gonna start this post by lamenting. However, re-listening to her work again has 
really been a pleasure, especially while paying more attention to the lyrics in her latest album TTPD.

The songs will be ranked from S-F scale based on how much I like it. The album rankings wont rely on the individual song 
rankings, but will instead be ranked in a similar way to the individual songs: by how much I like them.

We'll start with TTPD.

## The Tortured Poets Departments (2024)

Best song on this album: **Guilty as Sin**

Runner Up: **Florida!!!**

This album is like if Taylor Swift wrote an amazing book of poetry, then transposed it into an album. It's hard to passively listen to, 
but if you do listen in, you'll really enjoy every song (or almost every song).

There are some songs on the album that you *can* passively listen to and really enjoy; those songs really round out the album.

That's not to say it's her best work, but it *is* art that if you pay attention to, is really beautiful.

That said, some of the lyrics seem like poetry that's been forced to fit a certain melody, some vocal inflections feel over used; a little more 
variety of emotion in the album would've been nice.

Also some songs seem a little out of touch.

Disclaimer: This ranking reflects how much I enjoyed listening to each song. Also, I don't have the time to research the full context 
to every single song, which may affect my opinion of it on the rating scale.  

I need to re-rank the B songs here later.

- S: Fortnight, Down Bad, So Long London, Florida!!!, Guilty as Sin,  I Can Do It With a Broken Heart, The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived, 
So High School
- A: Peter, The Tortured Poets Department, My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys, I Can Fix Him (No Really I can), Clara Bow, The Albatross, 
imgonnagetyouback, I Hate It Here, thanK you aIMee, The Manuscript
- B: But Daddy I Love Him, Fresh Out The Slammer, loml, The Alchemy, The Black Dog, Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus, How Did It End?, I Look in People's Windows, 
The Prophecy, Cassandra, The Bolter, Robin
- C: Who's Afraid of Little Old Me (with 31 songs a flop was inevitable)

Moving onto Midnights...

## Midnights (2022)

Nice! :)

Best song on this album: **Bewjeweled**

Runner Up: **Vigilante Shit**

I'll note that I'm listening to each album in reverse order of release date. Starting from most recent to least recent.

This means that I'm coming into this review of Midnights from a perspective of having just listened to all 31 tracks on TTPD.

I think this album has less really really good songs but also less underwhelming songs (The album is half the size, after all!). All of the songs whelmed me, and some were really really good.

- S: Lavender Haze, Anti-Hero, Vigilante Shit, Bejeweled, Karma
- A: Maroon, You're On Your Own Kid, Midnight Rain, Snow On The Beach, Question... ?, Labyrinth, Sweet Nothing, Mastermind

Overall, I'd say this album whelmed me, but it definitely could've been a lot better. I felt great about the album on first listen, but on subsequent listens,
it didn't enamour me.

## Folklore (2020)

Best song on this album: **betty**

Runner Up: **my tears ricochet**

Coming from Midnights, honestly I'd say Folklore is really refreshing! I gotta say that listening to this one really constrasts with the previous two 
I listened to above, because it has much more musical pull, and still great lyrically.

- S: the 1, cardigan, the last great american dynasty, my tears ricochet, mirrorball, betty, seven, august, illicit affairs, invisible string, hoax
- A: mad woman, exile, this is me trying
- B: peace
- C: epiphany

## Evermore (2020)

Best song on this album: **no body, no crime**

Runner Up: **willow**

- S: willow, champagne problems, no body no crime, happiness, long story short 
- A: gold rush, 'tis the damn season, tolerate it, dorothea, ivy, cowboy like me, marjorie
- B: coney island, closure, evermore

## Lover (2019)

- A: The Archer, Cornelia Street, London Boy, Afterglow, It's Nice To Have a Friend

## Reputation (2017)

Tbh, this album and lover might be tying for first place. Every song on this album is amazing.

## Albums Ranked

At this point I can't say I have a favourite album. The S Tier albums are all as good as eachother, that feels like a more whole answer 
than choosing a favourite.

Disclaimer: *all of her albums are really good*

### S-Tier

In S Tier are Lover, Reputation, Speak Now, Red, Fearless, and Folklore

Honestly, I can't rate these in any specific order. They are all very good in their own ways and to rate them in an order 
would be to take away some essence from them that I don't want to take away.

### A-Tier

1. 1989
2. The Tortured Poets Department

### B-Tier

1. Evermore
2. Midnights
3. Debut

I've definitely changed my perspective on my Taylor Swift ranking in this post while re-listening to her entire discography.

This is definitely subject to change but I think this is a good representation.
