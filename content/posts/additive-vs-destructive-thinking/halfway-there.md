When building a website, making a Minecraft world, decorating a house, building a program, or whatever, we can often get a new idea for how we want it to be done.

Imagine you want to redecorate your house. What is your first step in doing so? Is it to blow up the foundations with TNT and hire a bunch of workmen to rebuild it brick by brick in the way you want?

Your first step would probably be to clean the existing house up a bit, get the paint out, or put up a new shelf here and there, some different posters, right?

Could you say the same about other things in your life? Do you, when loading up Minecraft again after a 6 month break, make a new world? Do you, when you come up with an idea for a new website design, do it from scratch? Do you do rewrite after rewrite of your idea for an application you want to make? Or rewrite your neovim configuration every 6 months?

You may or may not have faced this issue, but I have! So recently I redesigned this website, and I was thinking of blowing it up and starting anew. However, I calmed myself down a bit, stole some font choices and colors from my friends, and resized some elements in the theme I was already using! Now I have my own Hugo theme based on the theme I was already using, and it only took like 20 minutes.

I also added an RSS feed: [index.xml](https://0x30.dev/posts/index.xml).

Shout out to [tesk](https://tesk.page/) for the font and font size and [amy](https://oomfie.gitlab.io/) for colors :)
