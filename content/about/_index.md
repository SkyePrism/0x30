When thinking about growth, we often think individualistically about it.

There can be a tendency to hyperfocus in on ourselves personally, when our growth can be shared with others.

Not only does sharing your growth with others benefit you socially, but when we share our thoughts with others, we all benefit.

Through back and forth knowledge-sharing, we uplift eachother and we uplift our shared social spaces with our shared knowledge.

Writing blogs builds our connections with others, forms spaces which alleviate loneliness, and helps everyone grow.
